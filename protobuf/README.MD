# Protobuf Reader

Beatstar makes heavy use of protobufs and not always in defined ways. This tool aims to decode protobufs based on user defined schemas to match the originals and re-encode them.

This is very muc still a work in progress. CMS files will be used as test subjects for ensuring functionality isn't broken through changes.
